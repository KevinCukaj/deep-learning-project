## Abstract

Deep learning approach for audio super-resolution. We implement a U-Net architecture with skip connections that directly operates on raw waveforms. Our method captures both temporal and frequency characteristics of audio signals, effectively reconstructing the high-frequency components lost in low-resolution recordings. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in both objec tive metrics and subjective quality when applied to music samples from the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset.
